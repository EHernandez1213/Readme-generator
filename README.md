# Readme Generator

  ## Description

  This project was created because I want a faster way to create readme files.
  What this does is it creates a readme file with answers from a prompt.
  What I learned from project was how to generate files with fs, how to use other scripts in my scripts using require, and how to build a template using template literals.
